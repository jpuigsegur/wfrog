  * [http://code.google.com/p/wfrog/issues/list?can=1&q=label%3AMilestone-Release0.5&colspec=ID+Type+Status+Priority+Milestone+Owner+Summary&cells=tiles Fixed Issues]
  * The architecture has been reworked and now offers full extensibility through an homogeneous YAML configuration system.
  * MySQL and CSV file storages (only wflogger). 
  * Changes in the configuration:
    * The element !multi is now generic. Its children must not be named 'renderers' but 'children'.
    * The chart options that took 'on' or 'off' are now taking 'true or false', to be consistent.
    * The chart option y_margin is now ymargin, to be consistent as well.
    * Changed the !include and !template tags so that the paths are relative to the file where they appear and not from the current working directory.

*wfrog 0.1 - 24.11.2009*
