#summary Ideas that will guide the development of wrfog 0.9.

<wiki:toc/>

= Context =

We have several wishes for wfrog 0.9 needing a re-design of how samples are handled. It should be mostly leading to a more generic design where the list of measures in a sample is configured with how they are calculated, which are stored, etc.

We want to express the overall architecture and design in an homogeneous form on this page so that we can discuss it as a whole.

The concerned issues are:
  * Issue 11: Support for several temp / hum sensors. 	 	 
  * Issue 28: Alternative way of obtaining current data from last stored measure 	 
  * Issue 29: Generate critical log messages when batteries are low 	 
  * Issue 32: Introduce scalar functions
