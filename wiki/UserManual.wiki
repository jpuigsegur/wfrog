== Trying wfrog before buying a station ==

You can figure out what wfrog looks like even without station.

Simply run:
{{{
wfrog -d
}}}

In debug mode, if no station is detected, a station simulator is used instead. This is useful during the very development of wfrog, to test configuration and can also give an idea how wfrog works if we don't have any station (yet).

== Running wfrog as user or root ==

The usual way is to run wfrog as root. You may want however to test some configuration or for any other reason run wfrog under a different user.

Here are the differences between running as root or as a user:

=== As root ===

   * Data are located in `/var/lib/wfrog`
   * Settings are located in `/etc/wfrog/settings.yaml`
   * Custom configuration is located in `/etc/wfrog/`.
   * Logs are located in `/var/log`

=== As user ===

   * Data are located in `~/.wfrog/data`
   * Settings are located in `~/.wfrog/settings.yaml`. If absent, wfrog uses the ones in `/etc/wfrog/settings.yaml`
   * Custom configuration is located in `~/wfrog/`. If absent, and a custom configuration exists in `/etc/wfrog`, this latter is used.
   * Logs are located in `
